#Deep Learning Model for Xray Image Classification

This project is primarily focused on the creation and training of deep learning models with a specific objective: to categorize bone health into three distinct classes - healthy bones, bones 
requiring medical attention, and bones that are irreparable.

By leveraging advanced deep learning techniques, we aim to provide a robust solution that could potentially revolutionize the field of orthopedics. The ability to correctly categorize bone
health could serve as a critical tool for medical practitioners, enabling them to make more accurate diagnoses and subsequently, administer more effective treatments.
